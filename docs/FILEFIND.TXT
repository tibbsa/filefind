            Some Background Information

            FileFind is  designed to  respond to  ``FileFind'' requests.
            This method of  locating information via  FidoNet-compatible
            systems was first  introduced by Allfix,  a .TIC  processor.
            To the best of  my knowledge, this  (rather large) piece  of
            software is the only package which supports these requests.

            There are several people  that I know who  would like to  be
            able to  process these  requests automatically,  but do  not
            want to use Allfix to achieve this goal.  One of the biggest
            reasons that people don't want to  use Allfix is because  of
            it's bloated  size.   As  well,  when you've  been  using  a
            complete Areafix/.TIC processor for years, it's a real  PITA
            to convert all of your configuration files over to some  new
            system.


            Developement Information

            History:
               Date       Ver               Notes/Description
                ---       1.1    - Completely rewritten documentation.
             Mar 18 98    1.0    - Initial public release

            * Techie Note:   For those who just  need to know,  FileFind
            (and all associated utilities) were written in C for  speed.
            The documentation  in  version 1.0  was  written  completely
            within  Edit,  because  of   some  technical  difficulties.
            However, in  version  1.1+,  all of  the  documentation  was
            written in Microsoft Word 6.0a for Windows and postprocessed
            by a quick hack written by Scott Dudley (thanks, Scott!).


            Installation

            Installation of  Filefind  is quite  simple.   There  is  no
            installation utility required  to setup Filefind.   All  you
            have to do is  dearchive Filefind into  a directory of  your
            choice (in this  documentation, we will  assume Filefind  is
            installed in C:\FileFind), and then modify the configuration
            file to suit your system.

            For Maximus  users  (I've  assumed that  nobody  is  running
            anything older  than  version  2.0), a  special  utility  is
            included to convert  all of your  FILEAREA.CTL files into  a
            FileFind configuration  file.   This utility  can be  easily
            expanded to  support other  BBS systems  - if  you have  the
            structures/format for a particular system, please feel  free
            to send it to me.  (See ``Contacting the Author'' at the end
            of this documentation.)




                                        - 4 -





            For other systems, however, you will have to manually  enter
            all of  your file  areas into  your FileFind  configuration.
            This need only be done once, but if you have a large  number
            of file areas this can be time consuming.

            System Requirements

            FileFind  should   run  fine   on  the   following   minimum
            configuration:

                 *MS-DOS/PC-DOS 3.3+, Windows  95, Windows NT,  or OS/2
                  2.1+
                 * 120k of disk space
                 * MINIMUM  of 196k  of  free conventional  memory  (see
                  below)
                 * Squish or *.MSG message bases to scan
                 * FILES.BBS file areas to scan (see note below)

            Optionally, if you wish  to use SortArea, loading  SHARE.EXE
            is a very good idea.

            Your exact memory requirements will  vary.  Keeping in  mind
            that each message  area requires about  480 bytes, and  each
            file  area  requires  about  312  bytes,  the  exact  memory
            requirements  will   depend  heavily   on  the   number   of
            message/file areas you are scanning.   For a typical  system
            scanning 2 message areas  and 45 file  areas, you will  need
            about 205k of free conventional memory.

            NOTE:     Neither FileFind nor  SortArea support  multi-line
                      descriptions.  This  means that your  descriptions
                      must  be  on  one  line  in  the  FILES.BBS  file.
                      SortArea will not preserve multi-line descriptions
                      or comment lines, so please make a backup of  your
                      file lists before running this program if you  are
                      in doubt.   FileFind  will perform  all  necassary
                      word-wrapping when it writes reply messages.

            What You Have (or Don't Have)

            You should find the following files in the FileFind archive:

                CONVERT.EXE     A small  utility  to convert  a  Maximus
                                2.x/3.x FILEAREA.CTL file into a  format
                                which can be used by FileFind.
                SORTAREA.EXE    Sorts your FILES.BBS listings.
                FILEFIND.EXE    The main FileFind program.
                FILEFIND.CFG    Example configuration  for FileFind  and
                                SortArea.
                MAXAREAS.CFG    Example configuration  for FileFind  and
                                SortArea.
                HEADER.TXT      Example response message header.
                FOOTER.TXT      Example response message footer.
